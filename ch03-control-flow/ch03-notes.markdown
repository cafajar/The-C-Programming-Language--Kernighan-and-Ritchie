# Control Flow

## Summary
1. `;` terminates a statement and `{}` define blocks, or compound statements.
2. `If-Else` statements express a decision.
3. `Else-If` to express multi-way decision paths.
4. `Switch` to test against constant int values.
5. `for` loops equivalent to `while`. Use former when initialization, incrementing.

## 3.1 Statements and Blocks


## 3.2 If-Else
Always use braces with nested `If-Else` statements to avoid ambiguity with `Else` block.


## 3.3 Else-If


## 3.4 Switch
`break` to avoid falling through to next case.


## 3.5 Loops - While and For


## 3.6 Loops - Do-while


## 3.7 Break and Continue


## 3.8 Goto and Labels
