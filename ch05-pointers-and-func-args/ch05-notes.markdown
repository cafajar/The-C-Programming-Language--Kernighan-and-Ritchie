# Chapter 5: Pointers and Function Arguments

## Summary
1. Pointer variables hold addresses of variables or array elements.
2. C calls by value so use pointers to access and modify things in the calling function.
3. Array variables and pointers are similar; an array-and-index expression are equivalent to pointer-and-offset expression.
4. We can add/subtract pointers in same array, or with integers.
5. Character pointers provide several benefits over arrays when dealing with strings.
