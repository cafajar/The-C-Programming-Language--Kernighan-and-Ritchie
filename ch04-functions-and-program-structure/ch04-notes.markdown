# Chapter 4: Functions and Program Structure

## Summary

1. Break code into smaller portions to improve testability, refactoring, modularity.
2. Be aware of expected and given return value types.
3. Use external variables sparingly when data must be shared between functions.
4. `extern` declares a variable but does not define it.
5. Header files centralize the definitions and declarations shared amongst files in an application.
6. `static` external variables or funcs are only accessible inside their file. `static` internal variables persist through function calls.
7. Use `register` declaration with heavily used variables to store in register.
8. Variables can be defined inside blocks.
9. Variable types initialize differently. Explicit is better than implicit!
10. Recursion can make code more compact and intuitive.
